## Who is Harry?

Harry Craddock (August 29, 1876 – January 25, 1963) was one of the most famous bartenders of the 1920s and 1930s.

Born in Stroud, United Kingdom, Craddock moved to the United States, where he worked at Cleveland's Hollenden Hotel and New York's Knickerbocker Hotel and Hoffman House, becoming a United States citizen. He left during Prohibition and joined the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel, London, in 1920.

Craddock’s "The Savoy Cocktail Book" was first published in 1930, and is still in print today. He is sometimes credited with creating a number of classic cocktails, including the famous Corpse Reviver #2 and White Lady.
